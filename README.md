# Budgeting App

The Budgeting App is a web application that allows users to log in and manage their financial information. Users can create a budget list and log their financial transactions, such as wages, gifts, phone bills, gas expenses, and other expenses or income. The app calculates the bank account total based on the logged items.

After clicking the edit button on the transaction details page, it leads the user to the edit transaction page and has to fill in the fields to submit.
